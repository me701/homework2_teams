# Homework 2 Teams

These are the team assignments for Homework 2.

# Instructions

For homework 2, you will be making and receiving pull requests
based on where your Classroom identifier sits alphabetically.
You will make a pull request to the person who comes after you in the list.
The same will be done by the person who comes before you. The last person in the list
makes a request to the first person in the list.

In order to make sure we're all on the same page, each of you
must make a pull request into *this* repository that adds your
GitHub id after your Classroom identifier.  In the third and fourth columns,
you will add the Classroom identifier of who you will PR into and who will PR into you.  

For example, a classroom with three students having identifiers
alpha, beta, and gamma would have this table:

```
#ME    MY_GIT_ID       MAKE_PR_TO  GET_PR_FROM
alpha  @alpha_git_id   beta        gamma  
beta   @beta_git_id    gamma       alpha
gamma  @gamma_git_id   alpha       beta
```

Below is a list of your GitHub Classroom identifiers in 
alphabetical order.
